The mission of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield is “To improve the health of the people we serve.”<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Premier Benefits and the Nation’s Largest Network</span><br>Convenience, access, seamless administration — what your employees want, they get with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s PPO health benefit program. Because Anthem is a member of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association,* Anthem PPO members access care through the BlueCard® program. That means a dedicated claims processing system and a cross-country network linking 90 percent of doctors and 80 percent of hospitals in America. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Corporate Alliance</span><br>Anthem’s parent company is an Indiana-domiciled publicly traded company that, through its subsidiary companies, provides health care benefits and services to approximately 28 million people. Anthem’s parent company, which is based in Indianapolis, is the Blue Cross licensee in California and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee in 12 other states:  Colorado, Connecticut Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia (excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington, D.C. More information about Anthem is available at www.anthem.com.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anthem Overview</span><br>Anthem evolved in the mid 1990’s following the merger of The Associated Group of Kentucky and Indiana, and the Community Mutual Insurance Company in Ohio. This merger was the nation&#39;s first multi-state integrated health care system. In late 1997, the company established a second operating region, Anthem East, when it acquired Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut. In 1999, Anthem strengthened its presence in this region by announcing its intent to purchase Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maine and completing the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire in October. A month later, Anthem added Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nevada, thereby establishing Anthem’s third operating region known as Anthem West. On July 31, 2002, Anthem completed the merger with Trigon Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Virginia, establishing a Southeast operating region. On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. merged with the parent company of Blue Cross of California, making the combined companies the largest health coverage carrier in the United States.<br><br>Managed care continues to increase in importance in health care today. Anthem’s managed care mission is quite clear. As a manager of health care networks, Anthem pursues partnerships with leading physicians and hospitals, while striving for continual quality improvement through clinical management and the collection, interpretation and sharing of accurate information with providers and customers. Anthem’s strategy of building partnerships with exceptional physicians and hospitals allows it to deliver consistent quality and cost management to employers within Anthem’s service areas. Anthem’s affiliation with Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans nationally gives it the ability to serve employees outside the region served by Anthem.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Financial Stability</span><br>Anthem’s parent company is a Fortune 500 company.

The NCQA Excellent rating applies to the health maintenance organization (HMO) and point-of-service (POS) plans in Colorado. This designation signifies that HMO Colorado’s performance meets the most stringent quality standards in the industry. In December 2004, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield became URAC accredited in Utilization Management for its HMO and PPO operations in Colorado and Nevada.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Customer Choice</span><br>Employers look to the company and its subsidiaries for choices that meet varied and unique needs:<br><br>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) HMO Colorado provides two delivery systems connecting its provider network to members. The first is through Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) who contract directly. Though the HMO network is open access, these PCPs still manage a member’s care. <br><br>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) PPO’s give cost-effective choices from one of the largest provider networks in the Colorado offering the member choice. The PPO is a non-gatekeeper product.<br><br>Indemnity Coverage Some customers still look for traditional health coverage. At Anthem, traditional coverage has always been delivered through a broad network of participating physicians, hospitals and other providers.<br><br>Administrative Services Many customers look to Anthem for efficient, flexible and reliable administrative support of benefit plans that are underwritten and financed by major purchasers. These include, but not limited to, dental, disability or workers’ compensation coverage.<br><br>Individual Plans Anthem also serves individuals and others not covered by employer groups in Colorado. One of the most successful is the health-care coverage the company provides to children who do not receive cost-effective coverage under their parents or guardians health plans. The Blues brand symbolizes security for many of the people purchasing individual coverage.<br><br>Comprehensive Solutions Finally, with an already-broad product mix, the company can tailor its offerings to meet unique needs. It can analyze a customer’s benefit requirements and offer a comprehensive solution. For example, Anthem can coordinate HMO and POS health plans with disability coverage to give an affordable and complete solution. As the company marshals the varied elements of its product mix, and as it delivers customized solutions, Anthem has become a better partner to customers. In all markets, the Blues brand is a competitive advantage.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ancillary Products</span><br>The most trusted name in health care also offers dental coverage, plus a full range of term life, disability and voluntary insurance products, flexible benefit plans and third party claims administration to complete your benefits package.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anthem Dental</span><br>Anthem Dental offers a statewide dental plan in both Colorado and Nevada.

ConnectiCare was ranked number 1 for having the least number of complaints of all health plans in Connecticut. This is the 3rd consecutive year in a row for ConnectiCare to earn this top honor. </li><li>One of the Highest Ranked Health Plans in America - According to the magazine’s annual health plan rankings, U.S. News &amp; World Report with the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) has consistently ranked ConnectiCare among the top health plans in the nation. In fact, ConnectiCare was ranked sixth in the nation in 2005 and 2006, fifth in 2007, and thirteenth in 2008. Over 250 plans are evaluated for this ranking. </li><li> Customer Service - ConnectiCare earned the highest member satisfaction score for customer service of any health plan in Connecticut - according to the 2008 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey (CAHPS), the most widely used benchmark for health plans. </li><li>National Accreditation - ConnectiCare’s quality have been recognized by our industry’s toughest critic, the NCQA. NCQA is a private, not-for-profit organization that accredits health plans based on a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation process. Since 1997, ConnectiCare has had full accreditation from NCQA. In 1999, ConnectiCare was recognized for superior quality and service by being granted an “Excellent” accreditation status and maintains this status today. During the latest accreditation, ConnectiCare also received distinction in Member Connections, Care Management, and Health Improvements. </li><li>Disease Management - Health Industries Research Companies (HIRC) named ConnectiCare to its top selection of 2005 Leading Disease Management Organizations. Only 23 health plans, 5% of health plans nationally, received this designation. In addition, ConnectiCare is the first health plan with in-house programs to earn the HIRC distinction and the Disease Management Purchasing Consortium (DMPC) Savings Certification. </li><li>Recognition for Service and Training - ConnectiCare received the “Excellence in Practice” Award from the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) for its innovative customer service program “The Royal Treatment.” Only twelve organizations internationally have been selected for “Excellence in Practice” top honors. Others companies competing in the international contest for the top honor included companies such as FEDEX, Daimler Chrysler Motors Company, Ford Motor Company, and Hewlett-Packard Company. </li><li>Quality Improvement - ConnectiCare is an eight-time winner of the Connecticut Quality Improvement Award (CQIA). ConnectiCare has received gold and silver awards for managing disease and improving patient care quality.</li></ul>",

    "Carrier_Description__c": "<p>Delta Dental offers a variety of programs aimed at managing costs for companies of all sizes. We offer a wide range of plans that provide enrollees with broad access to dentists, including managed fee-for-service, preferred provider organization (PPO) and dental HMO plans. Our fee-for-service and PPO plans feature The <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Delta Difference®</span> - built-in cost management and quality of care mechanisms designed to protect enrollees from:</p>\n<ul><li>Charges greater than the amount defined by Delta as the patient’s covered benefit; </li><li>Unnecessary paperwork – Delta dentists file claims for their patients and are paid directly by us; </li><li>Unprofessional standards of hygiene, radiation safety and other areas related to quality of care; </li><li>Unnecessary dental services; </li><li>Fraud – Delta works with government regulators and law enforcement agencies to curb program abuse.</li></ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Delta Dental Premier</span> – the nation’s largest fee-for-service dental plan. In California, 91 percent of dentists participate in the Premier network, and there is a statewide enrollment of 3.2 million. Our nationwide network encompasses 152,000 dental office locations, the largest network in the country. This program features:</p>\n<ul><li>Freedom to choose any dentist (with lower out-of-pocket costs when visiting a Delta dentist); </li><li>No balance billing – dentists accept Delta’s allowed fees; </li><li>No paperwork for patients to file – dentists submit claims on behalf of the patient;</li></ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Delta Dental PPO </span>– a moderately priced plan that covers nearly 4 million people and offers more than 12,200 dentist locations in California and 78,000 dentist locations nationwide. Our PPO plan combines the cost savings of managed care with the flexibility and choice of a fee-for-service plan. This program features:</p>\n<ul><li>Freedom to visit any licensed dentist (with the greatest cost savings when visiting a PPO network dentist); </li><li>Comprehensive network of specialists; </li><li>Unique safety net protection for enrollees who visit any Delta dentist;</li></ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What is the “Safety Net?”</span><span style=\"color: black; font-family: verdana; font-size: small;\"><br></span>Delta’s dental PPO is different from other PPO programs because of our unique safety net – a second network.</p>\n<p>Enrollees with Delta’s PPO plan have two dentist networks to choose from: the PPO network for the lowest out-of-pocket costs and the Premier network for managed costs and added conveniences.</p>\n<ul><li>Delta pays PPO dentists according to fee tables tailored to their practice area. PPO dentists agree to accept these amounts for their PPO patients. </li><li>Delta Dental Premier dentists (those who participate in the Delta network but who are not PPO dentists) also contract with Delta and agree to Delta’s determination of fees. The PPO patient retains the advantage – or safety net – of limited out-of-pocket costs when visiting these dentists. Premier dentists also complete claims free of charge and handle all paperwork.</li></ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">DeltaCare </span>– covers 900,000 enrollees in CA and allows enrollees to select a primary care dentist from a convenient network of more than 2,300 dentist locations in CA, including specialists, and 14,000 locations nationwide.

No matter which Delta plan they choose, small businesses can feel confident knowing that they have a program that protects their employees and provides their business with tremendous value.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">More about Delta Dental</span><br>Delta Dental of California, the state’s largest dental health carrier, administers dental benefits that cover nearly 16 million people in our commercial and government programs throughout the nation.

    "Carrier_Description__c": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Background</span> <br>Since its founding over 65 years ago, the company has grown into a leading provider of health plans and benefit services under the respected Blue Cross® and Blue Shield® brands. The Blues have been a historical leader in its markets and one of the oldest health plans serving the Rocky Mountain Region. The company provides health coverage to more than one million people in Colorado and Nevada through its Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), Point of Service (POS) and Indemnity health plans. The mission of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield is “To improve the health of the people we serve.”<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Premier Benefits and the Nation’s Largest Network</span><br>Convenience, access, seamless administration — what your employees want, they get with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s PPO health benefit program. Because Anthem is a member of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association,* Anthem PPO members access care through the BlueCard® program. That means a dedicated claims processing system and a cross-country network linking 90 percent of doctors and 80 percent of hospitals in America. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Corporate Alliance</span><br>Anthem’s parent company is an Indiana-domiciled publicly traded company that, through its subsidiary companies, provides health care benefits and services to approximately 28 million people. Anthem’s parent company, which is based in Indianapolis, is the Blue Cross licensee in California and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensee in 12 other states:  Colorado, Connecticut Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia (excluding the immediate suburbs of Washington, D.C. More information about Anthem is available at www.anthem.com.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anthem Overview</span><br>Anthem evolved in the mid 1990’s following the merger of The Associated Group of Kentucky and Indiana, and the Community Mutual Insurance Company in Ohio. This merger was the nation&#39;s first multi-state integrated health care system. In late 1997, the company established a second operating region, Anthem East, when it acquired Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut. In 1999, Anthem strengthened its presence in this region by announcing its intent to purchase Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maine and completing the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire in October. A month later, Anthem added Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nevada, thereby establishing Anthem’s third operating region known as Anthem West. On July 31, 2002, Anthem completed the merger with Trigon Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Virginia, establishing a Southeast operating region. On November 30, 2004, Anthem, Inc. merged with the parent company of Blue Cross of California, making the combined companies the largest health coverage carrier in the United States.<br><br>Managed care continues to increase in importance in health care today. Anthem’s managed care mission is quite clear. As a manager of health care networks, Anthem pursues partnerships with leading physicians and hospitals, while striving for continual quality improvement through clinical management and the collection, interpretation and sharing of accurate information with providers and customers. Anthem’s strategy of building partnerships with exceptional physicians and hospitals allows it to deliver consistent quality and cost management to employers within Anthem’s service areas. Anthem’s affiliation with Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans nationally gives it the ability to serve employees outside the region served by Anthem.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Financial Stability</span><br>Anthem’s parent company is a Fortune 500 company. The insurance industry’s most respected rating agencies continue to recognize Anthem’s financial strength.<br><br></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">AM Best = A               </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Fitch = AA-                   </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Standard &amp; Poors = A  </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Moody&#39;s = A1        </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">NCQA Accreditation</span><br>In September 2004, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield; subsidiary company, HMO Colorado, Inc., once again earned an Excellent accreditation status – the highest level awarded – from the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). The NCQA Excellent rating applies to the health maintenance organization (HMO) and point-of-service (POS) plans in Colorado. This designation signifies that HMO Colorado’s performance meets the most stringent quality standards in the industry. In December 2004, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield became URAC accredited in Utilization Management for its HMO and PPO operations in Colorado and Nevada.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Customer Choice</span><br>Employers look to the company and its subsidiaries for choices that meet varied and unique needs:<br><br>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) HMO Colorado provides two delivery systems connecting its provider network to members. The first is through Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) who contract directly. Though the HMO network is open access, these PCPs still manage a member’s care. <br><br>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) PPO’s give cost-effective choices from one of the largest provider networks in the Colorado offering the member choice. The PPO is a non-gatekeeper product.<br><br>Indemnity Coverage Some customers still look for traditional health coverage. At Anthem, traditional coverage has always been delivered through a broad network of participating physicians, hospitals and other providers.<br><br>Administrative Services Many customers look to Anthem for efficient, flexible and reliable administrative support of benefit plans that are underwritten and financed by major purchasers. These include, but not limited to, dental, disability or workers’ compensation coverage.<br><br>Individual Plans Anthem also serves individuals and others not covered by employer groups in Colorado. One of the most successful is the health-care coverage the company provides to children who do not receive cost-effective coverage under their parents or guardians health plans. The Blues brand symbolizes security for many of the people purchasing individual coverage.<br><br>Comprehensive Solutions Finally, with an already-broad product mix, the company can tailor its offerings to meet unique needs. It can analyze a customer’s benefit requirements and offer a comprehensive solution. For example, Anthem can coordinate HMO and POS health plans with disability coverage to give an affordable and complete solution. As the company marshals the varied elements of its product mix, and as it delivers customized solutions, Anthem has become a better partner to customers. In all markets, the Blues brand is a competitive advantage.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ancillary Products</span><br>The most trusted name in health care also offers dental coverage, plus a full range of term life, disability and voluntary insurance products, flexible benefit plans and third party claims administration to complete your benefits package.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Anthem Dental</span><br>Anthem Dental offers a statewide dental plan in both Colorado and Nevada.

These turnkey solutions provide our clients with the ability to remain strategically competitive in the ever-changing landscape of employee benefits, consumer-driven healthcare and compliance.</p>\n<p>In 1999, AmeriFlex and our banking intermediary, Metavante, helped pioneer the FSA debit card. As a result, AmeriFlex gained immediate and substantial market share and used this momentum to further enhance our technological capabilities, including the development of a consolidated debit card platform combining FSA, HRA, HSA, and CRA into one debit card, the AmeriFlex Convenience Card®. This singular approach provides simplification and ease of use for both employer and employee. The employer is rewarded with the savings derived from per participant rather than per account pricing, as well as real-time balances and user-friendly consolidated reporting. The employee is unencumbered with the confusion and frustration inherent in the understanding and use of multiple cards. Many TPAs who were late adopters of debit card technology continue to face the obstacles associated with dual processing platforms and data interface challenges. Ten years of refining the AmeriFlex Convenience Card® system have allowed us to take full advantage of the potential inherent in this technology.  </p>\n<p>The power and simplicity of the complete AmeriFlex suite of services with particular emphasis on our utilization of a single debit card platform and web-based COBRA administration have positioned AmeriFlex as the industry leader.  </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PRODUCTS</span></p>\n<p>Eight years of experience refining the FSA debit card system has positioned AmeriFlex as an industry leader in providing technology-based, consumer-driven benefit solutions. We offer compelling advantages to employers and employees with our efficient, progressive delivery of a consolidated FSA/HRA/HSA/CRA debit card platform—the AmeriFlex Convenience Card®, the core of our total consumer-driven benefit solution. </p>\n<p>The Mongoose® COBRA/HIPPA services delivers a unique strategy for attacking and eliminating the complexities of COBRA/HIPAA administration and compliance.
